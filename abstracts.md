### Short abstracts (poster presentation):

Short abstracts should include a submission title and the maximum length of the abstract is 100 words (excl. title), to be submitted as a PDF-file. We aim to accept all posters the review committee deem relevant to the topic of the workshop, to the extent room capacity allows. 

### Long abstracts (considered for oral presentation): 

Long abstracts can be a maximum of 1 page of text including the title (A4 size, Arial 11pt font, 1.5 line spacing, 2.5cm margins) with a second page for example sentences, figures and references, to be submitted as a PDF-file.  

Long abstracts should be submitted anonymously; author information is only to be entered into the online submission form. The initial selection round will be performed on the anonymous abstracts, after which the programme committee will also take seniority and affiliation into account, prioritising junior researchers and researchers from underrepresented regions/languages. 

Please note that submission of a long abstract does not guarantee an oral presentation, but rejected oral presentation submissions are still eligible for a poster presentation.
