title: Multilingual Minds and Machines 2026
---

Computational modelling has long been a highly influential research method in the study of human language processing. In the last decade or so, the impact of computational simulations has further increased with the availability of models with human-scale knowledge of language statistics and the development of powerful linking functions (based on, for instance, information theory and distributional semantics) between model predictions and human processing, as well as the availability of large-scale, high resolution behavioural and neurophysiological language processing data sets.

However, relatively little attention seems to be paid to simulations of bi- and multilingual processing. For example, current large language models are, typically, massively multilingual yet they rarely make contact to theories and data of human multilingualism and therefore fail to increase our understanding of the unique properties of comprehending, producing, or learning a non-native language, of acquiring two or more languages simultaneously, and of the interaction between multiple languages in one mind.

This workshop aims to bridge the gap between the scientific disciplines of experimental psycholinguistics, computational cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. By exploring how empirical, human-oriented approaches can be more tightly integrated with the theoretical, computation-oriented methodologies, the workshop will further enhance research into the cognitive science of bi-/multilingualism.
