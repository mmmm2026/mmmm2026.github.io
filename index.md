title: Multilingual Minds and Machines Meeting 2026
---
<br>
Computational modelling has long been a highly influential research method in the study of human language processing. In the last decade or so, the impact of computational simulations has further increased with the availability of models with human-scale knowledge of language statistics and the development of powerful linking functions (based on, for instance, information theory and distributional semantics) between model predictions and human processing, as well as the availability of large-scale, high resolution behavioural and neurophysiological language processing data sets.

However, relatively little attention seems to be paid to simulations of bi- and multilingual processing. For example, large language models are, typically, massively multilingual yet they are rarely connected back to theories and data of human multilingualism. In this way, they are unlike traditional models of bilingualism that increase our understanding of the unique properties of comprehending, producing, or learning a non-native language, of acquiring two or more languages simultaneously, and of the interaction between multiple languages in one mind.

This workshop aims to bridge the gap between the scientific disciplines of multilingual language research, experimental psycholinguistics, and computational cognitive science. By exploring how empirical, human-oriented approaches can be more tightly integrated with the theoretical, computation-oriented methodologies, the workshop will further enhance research into the cognitive science of bi-/multilingualism.

#### Programme and venue

The workshop will take place on June 22-23, 2026, at the Max Planck Institute (https://www.mpi.nl/page/visitors-newcomers) in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

In addition to the keynote presentations, there will be a small number of submitted talks, poster sessions, and ample opportunity for informal meetings and discussions including a dinner and a social event. Participation is free but places are limited. If registration exceeds availability, preference will be given to attendees with accepted talks or posters, to junior researchers/students, and to people from less represented countries and institutes.

#### Important dates
- Submission deadline Posters/Talks: 15 March 2026
- Acceptance dates: 3 April 2026
- Registration deadline: TBA
